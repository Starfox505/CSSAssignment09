    <h1>What worked well for you over the last 9 weeks that aided in your
        learning process?</h1>
    <p>
        I think the thing that helped me most was the amount of help and support I got from the professor. I was extremely overwhelmed with both this class and the Javascript class, but he helped tremendously in keeping me on track! I think overall the thing that helped me the most is communication, as there was a lot of it throughout the course with the class and also one on one. 
    </p>
    <h2>What would you change about the course?</h2>
    <p>
        I would personally say that the only thing I would change to the course is changing the manner in which we do our Lecture Activities. While they are extremely important, and really do set you up for the assignments, I feel that they should be done in class, instead of at home before class. I loved the workshops, but I feel that the Activities would help others who are confused on the assignments or the concepts. Therefore, I would suggest to do the Lecture Activities as soon as you come in to class, and then immediately after do the homework workshop.

    <h3>Did you learn what you expected in this course?</h3>
    <p>
        I definitely did learn exactly what I was expecting to learn in this course, as I was ultimately hoping to learn typography and color immensely. While I did not do great in those two realms, I felt I got a much better grasp on how important both of these things are to web design. Overall I would highly suggest the class to anyone interested in web design.

    <h4>What concepts were new to you and what concepts had you already
        encountered in the past?</h4>
    <p>
        I would say a lot of the concepts I was aware of and encountered previously in HTML. However, the concepts were taken into much great depth than before! Therefore, I was unaware of how much CSS can do, and really how much there is to learn. I felt that this class definitely is best taught separate from the HTML/CSS course, as the basis that is given in the HTML/CSS class is great but not as in-depth on CSS and the immense possibilities that CSS has to offer.
